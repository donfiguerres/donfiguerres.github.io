List of tools that I've used throughout my development career that you might
find useful too. I use this list when setting up a new VM or workstation.

## Browser
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
  - It's most people's default browser although Edge has a better performance in
  Windows.
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com)
  - I use this personally for browsing.
  - It has a lot of default privacy features.
  - Can be used to test if a website will continue to function if all the
  security and privacy features are enabled.

## Editor
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Basically an editor on steroids.
  - Can function as an IDE through extensions.
  - List of extensions
    - Vim by vscodevim
    - C/C++ Extension Pack by Microsoft
    - CMake by twxs
    - Python by Microsoft
    - C# by Microsoft
    - Extension Pack for Java by Microsoft
    - Intellicode by Microsoft
    - GitLense by GitKraken
    - Git History by Don Jayamanne
    - Remote - SSH and Remote - WSL by Microsoft
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
  - Handy windows notepad editor.

## IDE
- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea)
  - Probably the best IDE for Java development.
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org)
  - Not the best IDE but I'm keeping it here since there are limitations in the
  community edition of Intellij.

## File Explorer
- [Multi Commander](http://multicommander.com)
  - Far Manager alternative.
  - Useful when opening a lot of directories simultaneously.

## Process Manager and Monitoring
- [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
  - A superuser alternative to Task Manager.
- [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)
  - A much more modern alternative to Process Explorer.
  - Note: This tool has been flagged recently as malware by antivirus softwares
  because malicious actors have used it in some attacks.
- [htop](https://htop.dev/)
  - A great process manager for Linux.
  - A modern alternative to top.

## Terminal Emulator
- [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org)
  - Remote connection to *nix and IBM i machines.
  - WSL can basically replace this tool but I'm keeping it here just in case.
- [WinSCP](https://winscp.net)
  - File explorer to a remote machine.

## Remote Desktop
- [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org)
 - Remote desktop connection manager where you can connect to multiple remote
  desktops and the connections are arranged via tabs.
- [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv)
  - X11 Window server
  - More actively developed than Xming.

## Virtualization
- [VirtualBox](www.virtualbox.org)
  - For hosting virtual machines
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - Modern day containerization.

## Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
  - Need I say more? Even this website version controlled with Git.

## LDAP Browser
- [JXplorer](http://jxplorer.org)
  - Free LDAP Browser

## Database
- [SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqldeveloper-landing.html)
  - No longer bundled with Oracle database starting from version 19.
- [IBM Data Studio](https://www.ibm.com/ph-en/products/ibm-data-studio)
  - DB2 development studio

## IBM
- [IBM i Access - Client Solutions](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-client-solutions)
  - 5250 terminal (green screen) emulator is handy when connecting to IBM i
  machines.
