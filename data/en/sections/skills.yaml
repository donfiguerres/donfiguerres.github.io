- name: Python
  logo: "/images/logo/python-logo-notext.png"
  summary: "Python is my primary programming language for automation, data
  analytics, and prototyping. Have used both for professional software 
  development and for personal projects. It's one my favorite programming
  languages due to its ease of use and wide community support which allows us to
  do just about anything with Python."

- name: C
  logo: "/images/logo/c_logo.png"
  summary: "This is the programming language that I've mastered the most, mainly
  because it is simple and hasn't changed a lot for years. My experience in C
  ranges from embedded programming to CLI tools to ERP backend services. During
  my time as a developer for LSF, I mainly worked on services (daemon in *nix
  platforms and Services in Windows) and CLI tools which also involved low level
  interprocess communications. I've also worked on a C compiler and an assembler
  - both written in C - during my time with ROHM."

- name: C++
  logo: "/images/logo/cpp_logo.png"
  summary: "My experience in C++ ranges from Windows desktop GUI to ERP backend
  services. Currently, I'm working on 'database drivers' written in C++ that
  connect our business logic and web services layer to the database. I've also
  worked on C++ GUI applications in ROHM. C++ is where I mostly learned about
  object oriented programming."

- name: Java
  logo: "/images/logo/java-logo.png"
  summary: "I'm using Java for web backend development - Java EE deployed on
  Wildfly and Websphere. Although I'm knowledgeable with the Spring Framework,
  I haven't used it professionally since my day job uses Java EE instead.
  I have used JNI to integrate native code written in C with Java code that runs
  on a Java EE application server. I have also used JDBC for database
  connections."

- name: C#
  logo: "/images/logo/Csharp_Logo.png"
  summary: "Although my I only started using C# recently, I've found out that
  it is very easy to learn and master especially for me who already has an
  extensive experience . It really is a 'better' version of Java as some say.
  I'm using C# current product of my team which is the Infor Spreadsheet
  Designer - a Microsoft Excel Add In built using VSTO technology."
