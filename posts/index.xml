If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, who use Windows as a daily driver for software development, you know that this makes life a bit easier.
Before the recent updates, you had to install an X Server and that is what you set as your display in your WSL2 environment - a bit old school.</description></item><item><title>Hosting a Website Using AWS S3</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/cloud/aws/hosting-website-using-aws-s3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 10:23:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/cloud/aws/hosting-website-using-aws-s3/</guid><description>NOTE: This post is still a work in progress.
This blog talks about how to setup a website using AWS S3 which might be intimidating for complete beginners. I also plan to create a tutorial/blog for complete beginners who want to setup their own website which I should link here in the future.
Overview Hosting a website typically requires you to setup the following.
Web Server - where all your files uploaded and served through the network Content Delivery Network (CDN) - where your static files are cached Certificate - for SSL Domain Name System (DNS) - where your domain name is registered Component What we&amp;rsquo;ll use Web Server S3 CDN CloudFront Certificate ACM DNS GoDaddy Step 1: Setup your S3 bucket Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account and enable Static website hosting.</description></item><item><title>VS Code Python Test Debugging Does Not Hit Breakpoint</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/vscode/python-test-debugging-does-not-hit-breakpoint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/vscode/python-test-debugging-does-not-hit-breakpoint/</guid><description>I had this problem in Python development environment wherein a breakpoint is not hit while trying to debug tests.

The ways to do that are listed below.
Option 1: The git/ignore file in the home directory The user&amp;rsquo;s ignore file is mentioned briefly in the Git documentation. You can add here your ignore rules the same way as you do it with your project .</description></item><item><title>How to swap the Fn and Ctrl keys in a Lenovo laptop</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/hardware/lenovo-swap-fn-and-ctrl-keys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 18:52:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/hardware/lenovo-swap-fn-and-ctrl-keys/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been issued a lenovo laptop for the first time and the first thing I noticed is this weird keyboard layout where the typical locations of the left Fn and Ctrl keys are interchanged. I&amp;rsquo;m already used to the typical layout where the Ctrl key is in the leftmost part followed by the Fn key. Fortunately, Lenovo has made it possible to swap the Fn and Ctrl keys through BIOS. The complete instructions are in this how-to article.</description></item><item><title>Common Tools for Software Development</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/common-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 23:34:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/common-tools/</guid><description>List of tools that I&amp;rsquo;ve used throughout my development career that you might find useful too.

Browser Google Chrome It&amp;rsquo;s most people&amp;rsquo;s default browser although Edge has a better performance in Windows. Brave Browser I use this personally for browsing. It has a lot of default privacy features. Can be used to test if a website will continue to function if all the security and privacy features are enabled.</description></item><item><title>Java Performance Testing Using Zerocode</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/java/java-performance-testing-using-zerocode/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 23:10:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/software-development/java/java-performance-testing-using-zerocode/</guid><description>In one of my previous projects, I had to add a performance testing suite for our Java APIs to measure the performance gain in the performance improvement that I was working on.
After some research, I found that Zerocode is able to fulfill our needs. Their GitHub Repo also includes an extensive documentation which made the process much easier for me.
I found that you can reuse your existing JUnit tests as performance tests using the LoadWith annotation.</description></item><item><title>Git Connection Errors During Cloning</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/version-control/git/git-connection-errors-during-cloning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:18:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/version-control/git/git-connection-errors-during-cloning/</guid><description>I got these errors recently when I was trying to clone one of our repos.

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) ... 3 * 2 * 1
For example
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
Just like the Fibonacci sequence, this is one of the basic forms of exercise used in programming and is commonly used to introduce recursion.</description></item><item><title>Fibonacci Sequence</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/programming-tutorials/fibonacci-sequence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:12:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/programming-tutorials/fibonacci-sequence/</guid><description>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers. This is one of the basic forms of exercise used in programming and is almost always present in a programming exam. Therefore, learning how to print the Fibonacci sequence is essential to anyone learning programming or a new programming language.
