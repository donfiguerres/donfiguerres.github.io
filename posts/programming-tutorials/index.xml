n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) ... 3 * 2 * 1 For example
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 Just like the Fibonacci sequence, this is one of the basic forms of exercise used in programming and is commonly used to introduce recursion.</description></item><item><title>Fibonacci Sequence</title><link>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/programming-tutorials/fibonacci-sequence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:12:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://donfiguerres.com/posts/programming-tutorials/fibonacci-sequence/</guid><description>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers. This is one of the basic forms of exercise used in programming and is almost always present in a programming exam. Therefore, learning how to print the Fibonacci sequence is essential to anyone learning programming or a new programming language.
